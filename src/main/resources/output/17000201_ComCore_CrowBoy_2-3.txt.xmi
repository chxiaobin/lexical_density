He was nicknamed Chibi because he was very small. Chibi means &quot;tiny boy.&quot; &#13;&#10;This strange boy was afraid of our teacher and could not learn a thing. &#13;&#10;He was afraid of the children and could not make friends with them at all. &#13;&#10;He was left alone in the study time. &#13;&#10;He was left alone in the play time. &#13;&#10;He was always at the end of the line, always at the foot of the class, a forlorn little tag-along. &#13;&#10;Soon Chibi began to make his eyes cross eyed so that he was not able to see whatever he did not want to see.&#13;&#10;And Chibi found many ways, one after another, to kill time and amuse himself. &#13;&#10;Just the ceiling was interesting enough for him to watch for hours. &#13;&#10;The wooden top of his desk was another interesting thing to watch. &#13;&#10;A patch of cloth on a boy�s shoulder was something to study. &#13;&#10;Of course the window showed him many things all year round. &#13;&#10;Even when it was raining the window had surprising things to show him.&#13;&#10;On the playground, if he closed his eyes and listened, Chibi could hear many different sounds, near and far. &#13;&#10;And Chibi could hold and watch insects and grubs that most of us wouldn�t touch or even look it. &#13;&#10;So that not only the children in our class but the older ones and even the younger ones called him stupid and slowpoke.&#13;&#10;But, slowpokes or not, day after day Chibi came trudging to school. &#13;&#10;He always carried the same lunch, a rice ball wrapped in a radish leaf. &#13;&#10;Even when it rained or stormed he still came trudging along, wrapped in a raincoat made from dried zebra grass. &#13;&#10;And so, day by day, five years went by, and we were in the sixth grade, the last class in school.&#13;&#10;"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="8 13 21 25 29 33 37 41 45 49 53 57 61 65 69 73 77 81 85 89 93 97 101 105 109 113"/></xmi:XMI>
